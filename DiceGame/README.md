# Dice Game

### Description

Simulates a simple game of dice between two players. Try it out by compiling:

```sh
javac DiceGame.java
```

and running:

```sh
java DiceGame
```

You can also customize how many sides are on each players' die by running something like:

```sh
java DiceGame 3 8
```

which will give Player One a 3-sided die and Player Two an 8-sided die (how unfair!). Check out the test harness and the rest of the source code for a more detailed look on how everything works.
